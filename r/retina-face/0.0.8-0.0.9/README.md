         ## Acknowledgements
         
         This work is mainly based on the [insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) project and [retinaface](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00641.pdf) paper; and it is heavily inspired from the re-implementation of [retinaface-tf2](https://github.com/StanislasBertrand/RetinaFace-tf2) by [Stanislas Bertrand](https://github.com/StanislasBertrand). Finally, Bertrand's [implemenation](https://github.com/StanislasBertrand/RetinaFace-tf2/blob/master/rcnn/cython/cpu_nms.pyx) uses [Fast R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083) written by [Ross Girshick](https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn) in the background. All of those reference studies are licensed under MIT license.
